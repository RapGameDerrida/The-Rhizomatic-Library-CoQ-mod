    <page> The wall will not stop screaming; I have not known peace since sentience first took hold.
    
     I write these lines in haste, as I doubt the concoction I cooked-up haphazardly to dull my hearing will last long. Truly, the animating device worked. It is one thing to parse the theories, and another to inscribe them into still matter. Given the lack of reliable data, I took certain precautions. The wall I chose for this experiment barely deserves the name: a half-collapsed concrete slab, traversed by fissures and cracks. The price was only justified by the trader agreeing to deliver the purchase to my basement. I dared not consider fulcrete or a sturdier material, yet needed an adequate amount of structural stability for the animator to function. Indeed, a wall that was concrete enough--pardon the word twist. My basement is empty and, if the wall were to attempt escaping, it would need to ascend a perilous set of stairs.
    
    The wall has not tried to escape. The animator, once activated, latched on to concrete in a gruesome, perforatory embrace. The exact process through which the animator bonded with the wall eludes me, as the device deployed itself with a shocking haste. I glimpsed flesh-matter--what seemed like flesh matter--being injected. It is as if the animator rearranged concrete while strategically spewing ooze and connective tissues, orchestrating the displacement of pre-existing material with great care for the logic of what makes a wall *a wall*. My language does not do justice to materiality--could it ever?--and I invite readers to approach this sleep-deprived ekphratic burst with skepticism. Should I acquire a second animator, I intend to create a local time dilation and chart the sentience-weaving process to the best of my ability. For now, there are more urgent issues.

    What does one do with a screaming wall?

    <page> How I wish to behold the sentient tree-city of Chavvah! The very thought invokes a series of sensical bonds. What is a city but a network? What are trees but assemblages? What is a sentient tree-city but moving parts performing as one? I am mindful of imperfections and discords, of course. Cities and forests are cacophonous, chaotic, wavering multiplicities forever on the brink of collapse. Surely, they disagree on much. And yet, *yet*, they hold together enough to warrant their names. This holding-together, regardless of tensions spawned by coalesced enactments of heterogenous nodes, would prove a welcome respite. After all, the sentient tree-city chooses to be a sentient tree-city. It upholds itself.

    Pardon me. Names and objects and things have been on my mind. I have not slept in three days. The wall stopped screaming the morning after its sentience-injection. Soon after, the wall began talking, repeating the same thing over and over. What am I? What am I? What am I?

    If I have not slept, it is because there is no satisfactory answer. Still, I tried to communicate, and have little to show for it other than these miserable scribblings. I have read stories to the wall, introduced myself, asked questions, inquired as to whether it needed help. The only hint of recognition involved the water ritual, to which the wall replied: What is live? What is drink?

    How should I know?

    It occurs to me that I take facets of this experiment for granted, and must loop back to basics. How does a wall speak at all? How could it scream? Why did it stop? The wall has no mouth yet screams. The wall has no tongue yet speaks. As much as I can discern, the sounds emanate from somewhere within, or around, the wall itself. Its voice, should it be called that, matches the elusive notion of concrete as a vocalized phenomenon--subjectivity be damned. Each word resonates as if formed out of the *concepts* of growls and grumbles. Syllables are sluggishly brought forth by rock-like aggregates gnashing against their neighboring parts in arrangements meant to produce the desired vibrations. I lack the tools to prove whether that is indeed happening. This may be, instead, esper-like mimicry. A trick, an illusion--and I am the fool. The Nano-Neuro Animator, through complex processes, analyzes the object to which it is applied and deploys rudimentary emulations of what the target *should* sound like. Sentience as artifice--a cruel deception.

    If that is what I believe, then why does rest not find me?
    How do I tell an object the story of what it is?

    <page> Tomorrow, I will make the trip to Grit Gate. I doubt the Bathrumites will welcome me, of all people, but perhaps my company will draw the tinkerers' interest.

    The wall walks. It has been four days.
    
    I do not understand how, and I cannot bear to look, but it is capable of following me. By now, the wall remains silent unless it hears my voice--at which point it asks, what am I? I prefer to hold my tongue. I refuse to shatter the wall, despite having the tools at my disposal. I do not know what this entity *is*, and it is not for me to know. I only wish to let it return to what it once was--a simple block of concrete, cracked and fissured, unmoving, unpleading.
    
    Perfect in its unthinking.

    Last evening, and until the sun rose, I wondered about all the sentient things roaming the world's expanses. I do not refer to those of us seemingly born with it. I speak of the *other* sentient things, upon whom consciousness is imposed along the way. Do they all react as this wall did? Do some of them speak in full sentences? Does sentience spread over days, weeks, or months? Do certain walls walk soon after being exposed to an animator? What makes this wall *this wall*? Would it protect me from harm? Is it *my* wall? What differentiates an object from another? 
    
    These are not questions I would ask any newly sentient being. The questions are reserved for us, the things who make other things think. Are we so alone? Are we so alone that we are willing to bear an object's wails to shield us from silence? Do we not deserve this loneliness, then?

    If the Barathrumites can excise the wall's nervous systems, free it from sentience, then I will pay whatever price they require of me. I will retrieve artifacts from the Deathlands if they so demand. I leave these notes behind so that they may wander, as all things are wont to do. I am afraid of how every object feels about us. I hope the Barathrumites will understand this predicament and that they have the means to carry out my desired undoing. 
    
    Should these notes end up in your possession--I have one request. If you ever cross paths with a walking, talking concrete wall, do not try to explain to them what they are. Simply acknowledge that they are. You may tell them, as well, that I am sorry.
