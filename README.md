# The Rhizomatic Library
### A Caves of Qud mod

The Rhizomatic Library is a periodically updated Caves of Qud mod which adds books, scrolls, parchments, and other readable oddities to the game world.

The books, for the time being, can be found in Joppa. Look for an odd bookshelf. They will eventually be moved to the Six Day Stilt.
