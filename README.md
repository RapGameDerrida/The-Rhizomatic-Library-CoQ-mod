# The Rhizomatic Library (a Caves of Qud mod)

# Description

The Rhizomatic Library is a periodically updated Caves of Qud mod which adds books, scrolls, parchments, and other readable oddities to the game world.

The books, for the time being, **can be found in Joppa. Look for an odd bookshelf.** They will eventually be moved to the Six Day Stilt.

# Installation

**Note: the texts can be read without Caves of Qud. Navigate to the "Plain text books" folder. The .md file should be readable in most browsers, or can be opened using a plain text or Markdown editor.

Download the folder called "The Rhizomatic Library", and add it to your Caves of Qud "Mods" folder. The Mods folder's location depends on your operating system and may need to be created if it doesn't already exist.
